              <i>"I had the pleasure of working with Anaswara during her three-month internship with us this summer, and she was an incredible addition to the team. <br><br>

              She jumped right in to support updates and improvements to iaff.org in WordPress, bringing enthusiasm, reliability, and a genuine eagerness to learn every step of the way. 
              Anaswara handled every task with professionalism, met deadlines with ease, and quickly became someone we could count on.<br><br>
              
              Any team would be lucky to have her. I can't wait to see all the great things she accomplishes next."</i>
